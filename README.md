# youdonthaveaproblem

This is a twitter bot which posts a tweet every hour. 

The tweet is structured like a common permaculture aphorism: "You don't have an X problem, you have a Y opportunity/deficiency".

For example: "You don't have a slug problem, you have a duck deficiency"

This bot goes and fetches 2 random article titles from wikipedia and interpolates them into this phrase.

Why?

Because I think it might once in a while throw up something funny or interesting.
